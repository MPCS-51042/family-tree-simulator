Notes: Nice work! The data analysis here is solid, and your trees look great. 5 point deduction on style because some of the methods are pretty large and it would be tough to follow exactly what's happening in each one; breaking it into some smaller methods or even extracting helper files would have been helpful there. but overall, great job!
